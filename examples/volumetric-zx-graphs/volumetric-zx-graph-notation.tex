% A spider with at most four legs must have all its leg in the same plane (X, Y or Z)

%\sc Minimal length of path connecting:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Two adjacent spiders of the same color lying in the same plane : 1
%	\item Two adjacent spiders of different colors lying in the same plane : 3
%\end{itemize}

% Assigning plane constraints may increase the Manhattan Distance between two spiders
% This means they are not adjacent in 3D and require a sequence of edges to connect them.
